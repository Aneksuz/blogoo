## Blogoo

This is a small blogsite that uses markdown files to keep track of and add blogposts. Used for practice and might add more advanced funtionality later on once I am more comfortable with Next.js

### Markdown formatting
```Markdown
-- Title --
-- Date -- 
CONTENT OF THE PAGE
```

This is essentially the same format as the Next.js basics tutorial (as of 2021-11-03). It worked well there and as this is sort of a my own take on the tutorial blog.
