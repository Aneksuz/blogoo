## Blogoo

This is a small blogsite that uses markdown files to keep track of and add blogposts. Used for practice and might add more advanced funtionality later on once I am more comfortable with Next.js

### Markdown formatting

```Markdown
---
Title
Date
---
CONTENT OF THE PAGE
```

This is essentially the same format as the Next.js basics tutorial (as of 2021-11-03). It worked well there and as this is sort of a my own take on the tutorial blog. Might add more data to the files at a later point but this will suffice for now.

### Notes and Observations

- [grey-matter](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/gray-matter), can be used to parse metadata of an markdown file. Used to fetch title and date from posts.
